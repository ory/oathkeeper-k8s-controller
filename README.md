# oathkeeper-maester

ORY Maester is a Kubernetes controller that watches for instances of `rules.oathkeeper.ory.sh/v1alpha1` custom resource (CR) and creates or updates the Oathkeeper ConfigMap with Access Rules found in the CRs. The controller passes the Access Rules as an array in a format recognized by the Oathkeeper.

The project is based on [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder)

## Prerequisites

- recent version of Go language with support for modules (e.g: 1.12.6)
- make
- kubectl
- kustomize
- [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) for local integration testing
- [ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) for local integration testing
- access to K8s environment: minikube or KIND (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind), or a remote K8s cluster


## How to use it

- `make` to build the binary
- `make test` to run tests
- `make test-integration` to run integration tests with local KIND environment

Other targets require a working K8s environment.
Set `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the proper value.

- `make install` to generate CRD file from go sources and install it in the cluster
- `make run` to run controller locally

Refer to the Makefile for the details.

## Command-line parameters
Usage example: `./manager [--global-flags] mode [--mode-flags]`

### Mode options

| Name | Description | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| **controller** | This is the **default** mode of operation, in which `oathkeeper-maester` is expected to be deployed as a separate deployment. It uses the kubernetes api-server and ConfigMaps to store data. | 
| **sidecar** | Alternative mode of operation, in which the `oathkeeper-maester` is expected to be deployed as a sidecar container to the main application. It uses local filesystem to create the access rules file. |

### Global flags

| Name | Description | Default values |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **metrics-addr** | The address the metric endpoint binds to | `8080` |
| **enable-leader-election** | Enable leader election for controller manager. Enabling this will ensure there is only one active controller manager. | `false` | 
| **kubeconfig** | Paths to a kubeconfig. Only required if out-of-cluster. | `$KUBECONFIG` | 

### Controller mode flags

| Name | Description | Default values |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **rulesConfigmapName** | Name of the Configmap that stores Oathkeeper rules. | `oathkeeper-rules` |
| **rulesConfigmapNamespace** | Namespace of the Configmap that stores Oathkeeper rules. | `oathkeeper-maester-system` | 
| **rulesFileName** | Name of the key in ConfigMap containing the rules.json | `access-rules.json` |

### Sidecar mode flags

| Name | Description | Default values |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **rulesFilePath** | Path to the file with converted Oathkeeper rules | `/etc/config/access-rules.json` |
