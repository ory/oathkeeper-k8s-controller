# oathkeeper-maester integration tests.

This directory contains integration tests for oathkeeper-maester The tests
execute against a cluster. For local testing use either minikube or KIND
environment.

## How to run in with "KIND"

- ensure KUBECONFIG is not set: `unset KUBECONFIG`
- execute `make test-integration` from project's root directory

## How to run it against a cluster

- Setup a test environment: either a K8s cluster or minikube. Install the
  controller.
- Export KUBECONFIG environment variable
- Execute the tests with: `ginkgo -v ./tests/integration/...` If you don't have
  ginkgo binary installed, standard `go test -v ./tests/integration/...` also
  works, but the output isn't formatted nicely.
